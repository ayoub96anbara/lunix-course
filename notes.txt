Components of UNIX:
----------------
two important components:
   Shell
   Kernel
   
1. Shell:
---------
-It is outer layer of UNIX operating system
-Shell reads command provided by user.
-Shell will check is it valid command or not
-If everything is correct, then Shell interprets/converts that command into kernel understandable form.

2. Kernel:
-----------
-It is the core component of UNIX.
-It is responsable to execute our commands with the help of hardware components
------------------

normal user ===> $ prompt
super user /root user /admin user ===> # prompt
sudo -i ===> super user can do :to switch to super user 
----------------------------

Topic-2: Linux File System:
--------------------
Types of files in linux:
----------
In Python everything is treated as an object.
In linux everything is treated as a file.

1. Normal files
2. Directory Files
3. Device files

1. Normal files:
--------
these files contain data. it can be text file or binary files
ex:
abc.txt
test.sh ==> Script file
test.py ==> Python file
test.java ==> Java file
sunny.jpg
vedio.mp4

=>In Linux file extension is not important. based on our content the linux can identify file type.

2. Directory files:
-----------
These files represent directories.
In windows, we can use folder terminalogy but in linux we can use directory terminalogy.

:)to check type of file: $ file name

3. Device Files:
---------

In linux every device(terminal, keyboard, mouse...) is represented as a file.
By using this file we can communicate with that device.
Inside /dev directory all devices related files will be there.

terminal is also a file.
terminal 1 ==his file ==> /dev/pts/0
terminal 2 ==his file ==> /dev/pts/1
how to know them? $ tty 


How to check file type:
----------------------
IN Ubuntu:
blue color files respesents: directories
remaining: normal files

in generaly we have to use: $ ls -l
ex:
-rw-rw-r--  1 hp hp   13561 Jan 12 16:58 'wifi code.odt'
drwxr-xr-x 32 hp hp    4096 Jun 26 12:48  workspace_angular
-rwxrwxr-x  1 hp hp     310 May 24 13:39  Xampp.desktop

The first character represents the type of file:
(-) means normal file
(d) means  directory
(l) means link file
(c)       character special file
(b)       block special file
(s)       socket file

Linux file system hierarchy:
---------------------------

Linux file system has TREE like structure.
It starts with root(/)
/ is the topmost directory.
sub directories:
bin  etc  dev  home  lib  usr  cdrom

1. bin directory:
----------------
bin means binary
It contains all binary executables related to our linux commands.

touch
cd
mkdir
ls

2. sbin directory:
----------------
sbin means systembin

Q. What is the difference between bin and sbin?
bin contains binary executables related to commands used by normal user.
sbin contains binary executable related to commands used by super user.

3. etc directory:
----------------

This directory contains all system configuration files.
These configuration files can be used by operating system itself.

/etc/passwd ==> all users informations  

4. tmp directory:
----------------


-----------------------------
to open documentaion for command :
$ man command

to open file from terminal:
$ xdg-open fileName
